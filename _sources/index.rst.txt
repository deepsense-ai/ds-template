deepsense.ai Project Template
====================================================================================================================

This documentation provides information about a basic template to bootstrap new data science or python application project, as well as contains some details about design choices and tools used.

It is a result of our experiences at `deepsense.ai <https://deepsense.ai/>`_ with building data science and python projects and is a part of our internal best practices.
Some settings might be less/more restrictive than you needs but we believe it is better to start with a good baseline and modify it later than to start from scratch.

Even if it is not a silver bullet, it is a great starting point for your project if you care about quality and security and you want to focus on building than on spending lot of time setting up the project.
