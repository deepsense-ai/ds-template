# What is it?

Its intended use is to generate basic, most common configuration - however each team and developer is encouraged to modify it for its special needs.

It is a result of our experiences with building data science projects and is a part of our internal best practices, however it is not a silver bullet and should be treated as a starting point for your project.
Especially some settings might be less/more restrictive than you needs  but we believe it is better to start with a good baseline and modify it later than to start from scratch.

# What are the benefits?

Generated project consists of:

1. Basic python package structure:
    * `setup.py` - compatibility for `pip install -e .`.
    * `setup.cfg` - package metadata and **dependencies**.
    * `pyproject.toml` - all tools configuration (if support is present)
    * a very minimal python code + example test
1. pre-commit hooks:
    * `black`, `flake8` - enforce code style
    * `jupytext` - (optional) sync jupyter notebooks to plain python files
    * `pycln` - cleanups unused imports
    * `mypy` - checks type errors
    * `isort` - sorts imports
    * `pylint` - provides static code analysis and enforces coding standard
    * `pyupgrade` - modernizes code for given python version
    * `bandit` - checks for security issues - required for SOC 2 Certification
1. Sphinx documentation:
    * basic preconfigured documentation template
    * recommended extensions
    * page with list of autogenerated thirdparty python packages list with licenses
1. Basic script to create venv
1. Minimal README.md file
1. Preconfigured semantic versioning with bump2version
1. Dockerfile for pre-commit image
1. Gitlab integration (default, optional):
    * linter stage (`pre-commit run --all`)
    * tests (`pytest`) + code coverage
    * license checks of installed packages
    * building and hosting documentation on GitLab Pages
    * building package and uploading to private GitLab Package registry
    * security: `trivy` - required for SOC 2 Certification
    * steps to rebuild linter docker image
1. Github integration (optional):
    * linter stage (`pre-commit run --all`)
    * tests (`pytest`) + code coverage
    * license checks of installed packages
    * building and hosting documentation on GitHub Pages (if enabled)
    * testing if package can be build
    * security: `trivy` - required for SOC 2 Certification, but is reporting only
1. Other less important files (more configurations, `.gitignore` etc)

# Getting started

## Usage

```bash
# Create a new data science application
uvx create-ds-app
```

## Available Templates

- **Standard Data Science Project**: A modern data science project template with workspace structure

## Development

To set up for development:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/deepsense-ai/ds-template.git
cd ds-template

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the CLI
uv run create-ds-app
```

## Creating Custom Templates

Templates are stored in the `src/create_ds_app/templates/` directory. Each template consists of:

1. A directory with the template name
2. A `template_config.py` file with template metadata and questions
3. Template files, with `.j2` extension for files that should be processed as Jinja2 templates

Available variables in templates:
- `project_name`: Name of the project
- `pkg_name`: Name of the python package
- `python_version`: Python version
- Custom variables from template questions
