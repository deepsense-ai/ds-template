## Pull Request template

Open the PR as a **draft**, and go through the self-review checklist before marking it as **ready for review**.

**Checklist before requesting a review:**

- [ ] My solution follows the software design principles: DRY, YAGNI, KISS, PoLA, and SOLID (unless a major refactoring would be required).
- [ ] I have not mixed refactoring changes with functionality changes (these should made in another PR that can be conducted in parallel but merged first).
- [ ] I have commented on my code in non-obvious areas.
- [ ] When adding or renaming environment variables, I have updated all relevant places.
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation.
- [ ] I have outlined all the changes in the PR comment.
- [ ] The PR title describes the changes accurately.
- [ ] (optional) The PR title starts with related user story / issue number.

⚠️ Before requesting a review, delete the above checklist, leaving only the list of changes made.
