A comprehensive project template generator for data science and Python projects that combines traditional template-based generation with **AI-powered project generation** capabilities.


This tool is designed to bootstrap professional data science and Python projects with modern tooling and best practices. The process starts with basic questions (project name, Python version, CI/CD provider) and then offers two approaches:

### ðŸ“‹ Traditional Template Generation
- **Package Selection**: Choose which packages you want to include (core, api, frontend, etc.)
- **Proven Templates**: Uses predefined package types and configurations
- **Modern Tooling**: Ruff, uv, MkDocs, pytest, and more
- **Monorepo Support**: Multi-package workspace structure

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Generation *(Recommended)*
- **Natural Language Descriptions**: Describe your project
- **Intelligent Follow-up Questions**: AI generates relevant questions to understand your requirements
- **Optimal Structure Proposal**: AI suggests the best project architecture
- **Template-Based Implementation**: Uses proven templates from the `templates/` directory
- **Interactive Customization**: Claude Code integration for real-time project adaptation

## Key Features

- **Modern Python Workspace**: uv-based project management with workspace support
- **Development Environment**: mise for tool versioning and environment management
- **Code Quality**: Ruff for fast linting, formatting, and type checking
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage reporting and async support
- **Documentation**: MkDocs with Material theme and interactive features
- **CI/CD**: Optional GitHub Actions or GitLab CI pipelines
- **AI Integration**: Claude Code for intelligent project generation and customization

## Key Benefits

- **Modern tooling** - Latest Python packaging, testing, and development tools
- **AI-powered generation** - Intelligent project creation based on natural language descriptions
- **Proven templates** - Battle-tested patterns and best practices
- **Flexible architecture** - Monorepo structure with independent packages
