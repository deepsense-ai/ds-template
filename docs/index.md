# deepsense.ai Project Template

This documentation provides information about a basic template to bootstrap new data science application projects, as well as contains some details about design choices and tools used.

It is a result of our experiences at [deepsense.ai](https://deepsense.ai/) with building AI projects and is a part of our internal best practices.
Some settings might be less/more restrictive than you need, but we believe it is better to start with a good baseline and modify it later than to start from scratch.

Even if it is not a silver bullet, it is a great starting point for your project if you care about quality and security and you want to focus on building rather than spending a lot of time setting up the project.

## Quick Start

To create a new data science project, simply run:

```bash
uvx create-ds-app
```

This will guide you through the project creation process with interactive prompts.
